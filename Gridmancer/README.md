## Gridmancer

> Disclaimer: This code is poorly written, both algorithmically and architecturally. It was written according to the first thing that came to my mind (non-optimal solution) and with a desire to finish projects that I start. 

After coding the entire thing in JavaScript, I pasted the code into CodeCombat's editor and got esoteric errors because of some weird compilation system they are using. I decided to port the code to python and successfully finished.

This algorithm solves the problem in 31 rectangles. This is a decent, but non-optimal solution.
